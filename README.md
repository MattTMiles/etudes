# etudes
JITted PTA analysis code for use with modern MC samplers such as NUTS. At one point I thought had some clever acronym set up for the name, something like **E**nhanced PTA analyses **T**hro**U**gh **D**erivative-based **S**ampling methods. It was too clunky... and the "U" felt shoehorned in. You can call it that if you want. I probably won't.

## Installation
Currently the best way to install etudes is through a pip installation of this git repository. Something like the following should do the trick.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/gabefreedman/etudes.git
```
## Favorite etudes?
I'm only really familiar with the broader repoirtoire for piano. The Scriabin Etude in D-sharp minor Op.8 No. 12 is a all-time favorite. The Chopin Etude in E-Major Op. 10 No. 3 is also up there. How about you?
